Web3 is the fastest growing number arena today in tech. Startup companies as well as established Web2 companies are both hiring people for web3 positions. If you want to break into Web3 then you need to be prepared for the interview process. Here are some of the most common questions you might face in an interview for a Web3 position.

## 1) What is Web3?

You might think this is a dumb question to ask if you are interviewing for a web3 position but it really isn't. This question will quickly weed out people who apply for a position because it is in a fast-growing arena without fully knowing what it entails. If you can clearly articulate what is web3 then you have done your homework and know why you are applying for this position.

## 2) What is the difference between Web2 and Web3?

If you blew it out of the water in your answer to the previous question, then you should have already answered this question. Sometimes employers will phrase the question like this instead of how it is worded in the previous question. 

Since Web3 is a seismic shift from Web2, you need to be able to explain the central tenets of Web2 and what are its characteristics. Then explain the weakness in Web2. Web3 is designed to fix the weaknesses found in Web2.

## 3) What is the difference between Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Stake (PoS)?

When answering this question you should be able to articulate which blockchains use PoS and which ones use PoW. What are the pros and cons of each? Which one do you think is better than the other?

## 4) What is a Smart Contract

A smart contract is a central part of the Ethereum blockchain. Any node can run a smart contract because every node has the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). 

## 5) What is the difference between Bitcoin and Ethereum Blockchain?

The two are clearly the largest two Blockchains in existence. Each has its own characteristics. You should be able to explain why they are different, why needs they serve, and why they are different from each other.

## 6) What is Dapp, DAO, Defi, Dex, NFT, Gwei?

These words are bandied about frequently in the Web3 world. You should be able to explain exactly what each one means and what they do.

## 7) What is Gas?

You should be able to explain what it is. You should also explain when you have to pay for gas as well as what you can do to reduce the cost of gas.

## 8) What is visibility in Solidity?

There are 4 visibility levels for state variables and functions in Solidity. You need to explain what all four are as well as why you would use each one.

## 9) What is the difference between public and private keys?

What are the differences and why do you need both? Should you or should you not share them with others?

## 10) What is your favorite blockchain project and why?

This question allows you to demonstrate your knowledge of Web3, demonstrate what areas interest you, and show your familiarity with what is happening in the Web3 world.
