OpenAI introduced a long-form question-answering artificial intelligence (AI) called ChatGPT that answers complex questions conversationally.

It is a revolutionary technology because it is trained to learn what humans mean when they ask a question.

AI will reshape our future, unlike any other new technology in the history of mankind. Want to learn more about AI? You are lucky because here are some free resources where you can learn about AI.

## Google

The makers of the most used search engine in the world, created a website to give a general introduction to AI.

Google provides a plethora of training courses and hands-on courses that cover all aspects of AI as well as machine learning.

## Helsinki University

The Government of Finland has the drive to educate its population on AI. This course was created for that purpose. Last year Finland opened up this course to the world.

This is an elementary-level class aimed at anyone who wants to understand what AI does, how it might affect them, and what it can be used for, without getting involved in the underlying mathematics and statistics. It demonstrates that in-depth knowledge of those fields isn't necessary to start taking advantage of the opportunities offered by AI and machine learning, and includes practical exercises.

This course gives a thorough grounding in the mathematical, statistical, and computer science fundamentals that go into developing and deploying automated learning machines.
